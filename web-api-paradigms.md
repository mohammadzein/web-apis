These are general concepts for building APIs, but not a specific tool or specification.

**Implementations** are something you can actually download, install, and use to build an API.

**Specification** (standard, recommendation, etc.) are often drafted up by various working groups, to help implementations share functionality in the same way.

gSOAP is implementation, following the RPC paradigm, SOAP is a W3C recommendation.
gRPC is implementation, following the RPC paradigm.

REST is a paradigm, has never turned into a specification, and has no official implementations.

GraphQL is implementation, following Query Language paradigm.

#### Things to consider when building an API 

- Coupling.
- Chattiness.
- Client Complexity.
- Cognitive Complexity.
- Caching.
- Discoverablity.
- Versioning
